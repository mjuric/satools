\mainpage Documentation For libpeyton Class Library

\section intro Introduction

libpeyton is a library of routines of use in astrophysical/astronomical
applications.

\section usage Usage

To link libpeyton with your code, do something along these lines:

\verbatim
export PEYTON=/u/mjuric/projects/libpeyton
g++ -o test.x -L$(PEYTON)/lib -lastro test.cpp
\endverbatim

Various parts of libpeyton need to be linked to other libraries (eg. fourier
code uses FFTW, FITS code uses CCfits, least squares fitting code uses GSL,
etc...). If you use any of these functions, the libraries for them are
already installed in my home directory. Eg., if you use FFT stuff, do
something along these lines:

\verbatim
export PEYTON=/u/mjuric/projects/libpeyton
export LFS=/u/mjuric/lfs/usr/local

g++ -o test.x -I$(LFS)/include -L$(PEYTON)/lib -L$(LFS)/lib -lastro -lfftw test.cpp
\endverbatim
