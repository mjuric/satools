- magnitude and velocity cuts thrown out of out2sdss.cpp
- velocity sanity check thrown out of cleanup.cpp
- setting velocity to 9.9999 if >=10 added to sarecord.cpp to prevent record
length overflows
- added to cleanup.cpp time correction to correct time for each object, instead
of having rowc=0 time of the current frame (THIS BREAK COMPATIBILITY WITH
ADR1 !!)

----- Apr27 03 -----
- Addedd dbconvert(from, to) function to identrecord.cpp to convert between
binary and ascii databases
- Added existence check to sa_createCaches - if a cache file exists, it
won't try to recalculate it (beware: if the file is damaged, the script WILL
NOT detect that)
- Written wrapper tool to call dbconvert() for converting between binary and
ascii databases, oiddbconvert.x

----- Apr28 03 -----
- Parallelized createcache - createcache2.x is the parallelized version. The
scripts do not yet call it automatically. It uses RemoteInstance mechanism.
Should investigate why it takes almost as long to calculate the skies as to
propagate the catalogs

----- TODO -----
- incorporate createcache2.x in sa_createCaches.pl script
- ask ZI to ask Steve to NFS-mount his directories

----- ADR2 issues -----
  +++ outstanding
  - breaking compatibility by correcting mjd field to show actual time
  - turns out that phi catalog field is also time dependent and was slightly
off due to time bug
  - ADR runlist seems to be screwed up (some older runs missing). Sent
e-mail to Zeljko about this.

  +++ fixed
  - check the TAI-UT issue [FIXED - just changed the last digit to 2004,
    because no new leap seconds were introduced]
