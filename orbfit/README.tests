[Note: the link to JPL ephemerides MUST be set up in ./lib with name
"jpleph". The location of the binary JPL ephemerides file is site
dependent. A binary file, but only for LINUX or Windows, can be
downloaded from our site.]

% cd lib

[REMARK: ../../jpleph should be replaced with the actual path and file
for the binary JPL ephemerides for your system.]

[This is the test sequence for all the main programs, orbfit, fitobs
and bineph; could take several minutes; much longer message,
terminating with:]

[Note that the test attempts to generate graphics on your printer;
this will actually work only if you have a PostScript printer on the
default print queue.]

[If you get any error message from the tests, please send a complete
copy of the standard output to some of the members of the ORBFIT
consortium, e.g. milani@dm.unipi.it, carpino@dm.unipi.it,
chesley@dm.unipi.it, giovanni@saturn.ias.fra.cnr.it]

[Now ORBFIT 2.1.1 is up and ready; you can use it immediately, by
modifying one of the .fop files in ./tests/fitobs and/or one of the
.oop files in ./tests/orbfit]
