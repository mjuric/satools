To create an OrbFit Distribution for Windows complete the following steps:

============ Compile UNIX Distribution ==============

1) Use WinZip to untar the .tar.gz file into an empty C:\OrbFit
   directory.

2) In Windows Explorer double-click compile.bat in the C:\OrbFit
   directory. This will copy the windows specific files from the conf/
   directory to their appropriate places. Next it will compile all
   executables. Alt+F4 will close the batch window when it is
   finished.

3) Again in Windows Explorer double-click windist.bat in the C:\OrbFit
   directory. This will remove all unnecessary object and link files,
   leaving the executables in bin/. It also runs the cleaning batches
   under tests/ and removes the jpleph file if it exists.

============ Test New Distribution ==============

1) Transfer the jpleph file to the C:\OrbFit\lib directory.

2) Under C:\OrbFit\tests\ directory execute the batch files
   fitobs\testfit.bat and orbfit\testorb.bat. Make any other tests you
   can think of including graphics if appropriate.

============ Make WINDOWS Distribution ==============

1) Again run windist.bat. (This will remove jpleph!)

2) In Windows Explorer right-click the C:\OrbFit directory and select
   "Add to Zip". In the dialog box be sure to:
	a) Enter a filename with the form OrbFit190.zip
	b) Select "Include subfolders"
	c) Select "Save extra folder info"
	d) Click "Add"

3) Upload the zip file to the ftp site. (!!! USING BINARY MODE !!!)
