The following directory contains some examples of usage of program
orbfit, having mainly the purpose of showing the different possible
modes of operation. Input options for each example are contained in
the file <runname>.oop. A log of all the operations performed during
the run is written in <runname>.olg.

4067
====

The simplest case: no specific option file is supplied, but only a
file 4067.obs containing astrometric observations. As a default
procedure, the program computes starting values of the orbital
elements with Gauss' method, then refines them with iterative
differential corrections (including automatic rejection of bad
observations).

1998PB1
=======

Two input files are supplied: an observation file (1998PB1.obs)
and an orbital element file (1998PB1.ele, written in MPC format).
The program reads the orbital elements and refines them with iterative
differential corrections.

1996RO13_gauss
==============

Application of Gauss' method to a single asteroid; differential
correction of the orbit (which would be performed by default) is
explicitly disabled by the option "operations.diffcor = 0"

Since no filename for astrometric observations is specified
(no keyword "object1.obs_fname"), they are read by default from
file 1996RO13.obs, since "object1.name = '1996 RO13'".

1996RO13_diffcor
================

Differential correction of the previous orbit: since a valid set
of orbital elements for the object are read from file 1996RO13_gauss.oel
(specified through keyword input_files.incond), no initial orbit
determination is performed, and the program computes directly the
differential correction. The type of output orbital elements is not
specified explicitly in the option file (no keyword "output.elements"
is present), so they are written by default as equinoctial elements.

An ephemeris of the object is also requested ("operations.ephem = 1").
The sky plane error (field "skyerr" in "ephem.fields") is reported in
the ephemeris file (1996RO13_diffcor.oep) as lengths of the principal
axes (1-sigma) of the error ellipse (Err1 and Err2) and position angle
of Err1 axis. The result shows a rapid growth of prediction errors for
ephemeris epochs outside the timespan of available observations
(1996, September 8 to October 6). However, since the sky plane
errors is computed in a linear approximation, it is only a rough
indication of the order of magnitude of the size of the region where
the object can be found when it exceeds few arcminutes. In those
cases, the real confidence region is no longer an ellipse, and its
computation requires more complex algorithms (see program fitobs).

1996RO13_ephem1
===============

Run performing only ephemeris generation, reading initial conditions
from the output of 1996RO13_diffcor (1996RO13_diffcor.oel); since
an orbit for the object (complete with covariance matrix information)
is contained in the input file, no differential correction is
performed.

1996RO13_ephem2
===============

Same options as for run "1996RO13_ephem1", but in this case the input
orbital element file is a subset of Ted Bowell's "astorb.dat" file
(astorb.sub); since no covariance information is supplied in input,
the program performs also a least squares fit.

1996RO13_ephem3
===============

Same options and input file for run "1996RO13_ephem2", but in this
case the program is forced to skip the differential correction by
setting "operations.diffcor = 0". The output ephemeris is based
directly on the orbital elements found in file "astorb.sub" and
does not contain sky plane error information (even though it is
requested by option "ephem.fields"), since no covariance information
is available.

1996RO13_ident1
===============

Example of orbit identification: two objects are specified (1996 RO13
and 1220 T-2). Initial conditions are read from file astorb.sub:
since asteroid 1220 T-2 does not appear there, its initial conditions
are computed with Gauss' method. The program computes separately
orbital fits for the two objects, and a final orbital fit adjusting
a single set of orbital elements to the observations of both objects;
residuals are written to file 1996RO1=1220T-2.rwo, which is renamed
afterwards 1996RO1=1220T-2.ident1.rwo by the instruction
"mv 1996RO1=1220T-2.rwo 1996RO1=1220T-2.ident1.rwo" contained in the
Makefile (this is necessary in order to play the trick described in the
next example). Automatic outlier rejection is disabled
(reject.auto = F).

1996RO13_ident2
===============

Example of orbit identification as above, using (as input orbital
elements for the two objects) the result of the previous example
(read from file 1996RO13_ident1.oel), but preparing a residual/weight
file for the identified orbit (1996RO1=1220T-2.rwo) by editing the
otuput residual/weight file of the previous example and discarding
all the observations leading to an orbital residual
sqrt(dRA**2+dDEC**2) larger than 2.5 arcsec (this operation is
performed by the Perl script "discard"). In order to avoid that
the program overrides the selection of outliers made by the user,
automatic outlier rejection is disabled (reject.auto = F).
