This is a preliminary version of a public domain interactive main program. 
The program FITOBS provides the following functions:

     +   'input of observational data=',
     +   'input of orbital elements=',
     +   'single arc differential corrections=',
     +   'twoarc differential corrections=',
     +   'state propagation=',
     +   'predictions of observations=',
     +   'multiple solutions=',
     +   'status=',
     +   'date conversion=',

and has a simple menu driven interface.

Other functions can be added later, with the goal of providing an
interactive (and hopefully user-friendly) interface capable of the
full range of OrbFit funtions.
