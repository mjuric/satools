This directory is for creating binary format JPL Epemerides. We have
provided at our ftp site binary files covering 1970-2030 for both
Windows and Linux systems. (Point your web browser to
ftp://ftp.copernico.dm.unipi.it/pub/orbfit/) This time frame should be
adequate for most uses. However if you need longer, you can use these
makefiles to create your own as follows.


1) Copy the necessary ASCII files into this directory. The files come
in twenty year chunks and can be obtained from a CD-ROM
(http://www.willbell.com) or via ftp from

	ftp://navigator.jpl.nasa.gov/ephem/export/ascii/

To use the make (or batch) file as it is, you need to download the
following files:

		header.405
		ascp1960.405
		ascp1980.405
		ascp2000.405
		ascp2020.405
	
These files yield a binary file covering 1960 to 2040. If you need
longer, simply copy the additional files, and then edit one of the
following to include the additional files in the "input.405"
file. (The files must be given in order!)

	1) Under UNIX edit the "input" target in "Makefile".

	2) Under WINDOWS with the Digital Visual Fortran compiler edit
	   the target "winput" in "Makefile".

	3) Under WINDOWS without the Digital Visual Fortran compiler
	   edit the batch file winephem.bat.

2) Now to actually create the binary file "jpleph" go to the src/jpleph
directory and give one of the following commands.

	1) Under UNIX use the command "make ephemerides"

	2) Under WINDOWS with the Digital Visual Fortran compiler use
	   the command "nmake winephem".

	3) Under WINDOWS without the Digital Visual Fortran compiler
	   use the command "winephem.bat".

3) Now you should transfer the file jpleph to the lib/ directory.
