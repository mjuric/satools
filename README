Building
=====

Assuming you have GCC 3.x or 4.x toolchain, to set up and build the entire
toolset, do:

./configure <g77|gfortran>
make

where you should select g77 for GCC 3.x and gfortran for 4.x.

The configure script will set up the basic environment required to compile
and run satools (e.g., will copy the necessary config files from setup/ to
your home directory, if they don't already exist). Compiled binaries will
end up in satools/bin, while various PERL scripts are in satools/scripts.

Running
=====

Source env.csh (assuming you use csh). This will add the satools binaries
to your path, and set up the SATOOLS and SDSSAST_WORKSPACE environment
variables.

Then, run whatever you need/want from the toolset. E.g., for start, try
this:

	source env.csh
	sa_downloadCatalogs.pl
	calcpos.x -runs -desig=Sedna latest ASTORB2 94

Which will first download the freshest ASTORB catalog, and then calculate
the position of asteroid Sedna at the time of run 94.
