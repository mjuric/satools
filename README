Building
=====

Assuming you have g++, gcc and gfortran, run the following (from the satools
directory) to set up and build the entire toolset, do:

./configure
make

Otherwise, first modify the F77 variable in Makefile.

The configure script will set up the basic environment required to compile
and run satools (e.g., will copy the necessary config files from setup/ to
your home directory, if they don't already exist).

Compiled binaries will end up in satools/bin. Scripts are in
satools/scripts.

Running
=====

Source env.csh (assuming you use csh). This will add satools binaries
to your path, and set up the SATOOLS and SDSSAST_WORKSPACE environment
variables.

Then, run whatever you need/want from the toolset. E.g., for start, try
this:

	source env.csh
	sa_downloadCatalogs.pl
	calcpos.x -runs -desig=Sedna latest ASTORB2 94

Which will first download the freshest ASTORB catalog, and then calculate
the position of asteroid Sedna at the time of run 94.
